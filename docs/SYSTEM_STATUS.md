# Work Order Portal System Status

## Current State: Organization-Based Authentication (Active)

### System Overview
The Work Order Portal now operates entirely on **organization-based authentication**. All legacy user-type dependencies have been removed, creating a clean, maintainable system.

### Authentication Architecture
```
User Login → AuthContext → Organization Memberships → Permission Engine → Dashboard Routing
```

### Core Components
- **AuthContext**: Loads user profile and organization memberships
- **Permission Engine**: Determines access based on organization roles  
- **DashboardRouter**: Routes users to appropriate interfaces
- **RLS Policies**: Secure data access via organization membership

### User Types & Access

#### Internal Users (AKC Contracting)
- **Admin**: Full system access, user management, organization management
- **Manager**: Work order management, report oversight
- **Employee**: Work order processing, report submission

#### Partner Organizations
- **Members**: Submit work orders, track status, view reports
- **Access**: Organization-specific work orders and locations

#### Subcontractor Organizations  
- **Members**: View assigned work orders, submit reports and invoices
- **Access**: Only work orders assigned to their organization

### Database Status
- **Users**: 8 profiles with organization memberships
- **Organizations**: 3 types (internal, partner, subcontractor)
- **RLS Security**: Organization-based policies on all tables
- **Data Integrity**: All users properly linked to organizations

### Migration Status: COMPLETE ✅
- ✅ Legacy user_type system preserved but inactive
- ✅ Organization-based system is primary
- ✅ All migration scaffolding removed
- ✅ Documentation consolidated
- ✅ Zero technical debt from migration

### System Health
- **Authentication**: Fully functional
- **Authorization**: Organization-based permissions working
- **Navigation**: Proper routing for all user types  
- **Security**: RLS policies enforced
- **Performance**: Optimized queries

### Next Steps
- Monitor system performance
- Add new organizations as needed
- Expand permission granularity if required
- Regular security audits

**Status**: Production Ready ✅
