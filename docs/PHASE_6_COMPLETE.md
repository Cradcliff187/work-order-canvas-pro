# Phase 6: Work Order System Migration - COMPLETE

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE  
**Date**: Phase 6 implementation completed  
**Feature Flag**: `useOrganizationWorkOrders: true`

## Overview

Phase 6 successfully migrated the work order system from user_type-based filtering to organization-based access control. The system now uses organization memberships to determine work order visibility and access permissions.

## Migration Details

### 1. Feature Flag Enabled
- Enabled `useOrganizationWorkOrders: true` in migration feature flags
- This activates organization-based work order filtering across the system

### 2. Core Work Order Hooks Updated

**useWorkOrders.ts**
- Added organization-based filtering logic
- Internal users: See all work orders (no additional filtering)
- Partners: See only their organization's work orders (`organization_id`)
- Subcontractors: See only assigned work orders (`assigned_organization_id`)
- Maintains backward compatibility with legacy user_type system

**usePartnerWorkOrders.ts**
- Updated to use organization memberships from enhanced permissions
- Falls back to legacy user_organizations table when feature flag is disabled
- Applies same organization-based filtering to stats and work order creation

**useSubcontractorWorkOrders.ts**
- Updated to filter by assigned_organization_id using organization memberships
- Maintains existing RLS-based security for reports and dashboard stats
- Proper organization context for all work order operations

### 3. Access Control Logic

#### Internal Users (Admin/Employee)
```typescript
if (permissions.hasInternalAccess) {
  // See all work orders - no additional filtering
}
```

#### Partner Users
```typescript
if (permissions.isPartner) {
  const userOrganizations = permissions.user.organization_memberships?.map(
    (membership: any) => membership.organization_id
  ) || [];
  query = query.in('organization_id', userOrganizations);
}
```

#### Subcontractor Users
```typescript
if (permissions.isSubcontractor) {
  const userOrganizations = permissions.user.organization_memberships?.map(
    (membership: any) => membership.organization_id
  ) || [];
  query = query.in('assigned_organization_id', userOrganizations);
}
```

### 4. Backward Compatibility

The migration maintains full backward compatibility:
- When `useOrganizationWorkOrders: false`, system uses legacy user_type filtering
- When `useOrganizationWorkOrders: true`, system uses organization-based filtering
- Gradual migration ensures no disruption to existing functionality

### 5. Query Key Updates

All work order queries now include organization context in their cache keys:
```typescript
queryKey: ['work-orders', pagination, sorting, filters, permissions.user?.id, useOrgWorkOrders]
```

## Validation Results

### ✅ Data Access Verified
- Internal users can access all work orders
- Partners can only access their organization's work orders
- Subcontractors can only access assigned work orders
- No unauthorized data exposure

### ✅ Permission Enforcement
- Organization membership properly restricts data access
- Work order creation respects organization context
- Assignment logic works with organization-based filtering

### ✅ Performance Impact
- Minimal query overhead with organization filtering
- Proper indexing on organization_id and assigned_organization_id columns
- Cache keys include organization context for optimal invalidation

### ✅ Backward Compatibility
- Legacy system continues to work when feature flag is disabled
- Smooth transition path for gradual migration
- No breaking changes to existing APIs

## Security Improvements

1. **Organization-Based Access**: Work orders are now filtered based on organization membership, providing more granular security
2. **Enhanced Permissions**: Leverages the organization permission system for consistent access control
3. **Proper Isolation**: Partners and subcontractors can only see relevant work orders for their organizations

## Next Phase Preparation

Phase 6 completion sets the foundation for Phase 7: Authentication System Migration. Key preparation points:

1. **Work Order Access Patterns**: Now fully organization-based
2. **Permission Integration**: Enhanced permissions system is working across work orders
3. **Organization Context**: Properly established throughout the work order system

## Success Criteria Met

- ✅ Work order queries use organization-based filtering
- ✅ Proper access control for all user types
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained
- ✅ No data exposure or security issues
- ✅ Performance remains optimal
- ✅ Organization membership drives work order visibility

**Phase 6 Migration Complete**: The work order system now operates on organization-based access control while maintaining full backward compatibility and security.
