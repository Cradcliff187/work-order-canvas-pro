### 2025-01-11: Critical RLS Fix and System Optimizations

#### 20250711035529-3ab24d6e-e01e-4941-97d0-b8c908d4523b.sql
**Purpose**: **INCOMPLETE** - Attempted RLS recursion fix (partial success)
- **Issue**: Previous RLS migrations (including 20250710231829) still caused "infinite recursion detected in policy for relation 'profiles'"
- **Root Cause**: ALL policies were calling helper functions that query profiles table (`auth_user_type()`, `auth_profile_id()`)
- **Attempted Solution**: Layered bootstrap approach with mixed success
- **Problem**: Still had some policies using recursive helper functions
- **Result**: Reduced but did not eliminate RLS recursion errors

#### 20250711042337-final-recursion-fix.sql
**Purpose**: **DEFINITIVE FIX** - Complete elimination of profiles table RLS recursion
- **Critical Issue**: ALL previous attempts had subqueries to profiles table within profiles policies
- **Root Cause**: ANY query to profiles table from within a profiles policy causes infinite recursion
- **Failed Approaches**: 
  - Helper functions that query profiles (recursion)
  - EXISTS subqueries to profiles (recursion)  
  - Direct subqueries to check user types (recursion)
  - Admin policies with `SELECT FROM profiles` (recursion)
- **Final Solution**: 
  - Stripped down to 3 minimal policies using ONLY `auth.uid()`
  - NO subqueries to profiles table whatsoever
  - Advanced permissions moved to application layer
  - Removed "Temp admin access" policy that contained recursive subquery
- **Result**: Complete elimination of error "infinite recursion detected in policy for relation 'profiles'"
- **Status**: **RECURSION RESOLVED** - Users can now log in successfully

**Key Learning**: Policies on the profiles table can NEVER query the profiles table - not even for admin access.

**Purpose**: **MAJOR** - Enhanced work order completion detection with automatic completion
- Added completion tracking columns to work_orders table:
  - `completion_method` (text) - Tracks how work order was completed ('automatic', 'manual', 'manual_override')
  - `auto_completion_blocked` (boolean) - Admin flag to prevent automatic completion  
  - `completion_checked_at` (timestamp) - Last time completion logic ran
- Created `check_assignment_completion_status_enhanced()` function with improved logic:
  - Supports both legacy (single assignee) and new (multi-assignee) models
  - Handles automatic completion when all required assignees submit approved reports
  - Respects manual completion blocks set by administrators
  - Updates completion tracking and triggers email notifications
- Added `trigger_completion_email()` function for email notifications:
  - Uses `pg_net.http_post` to call edge function for completion emails
  - Error-resilient design that doesn't block completion process
  - Includes proper authorization headers for service-to-service calls
- Enhanced `auto_update_report_status_enhanced()` trigger function:
  - Replaces `auto_update_report_status()` with enhanced completion logic
  - Transitions work orders from 'assigned' to 'in_progress' on first report
  - Automatically checks completion eligibility when reports are approved
- Added `set_manual_completion_block()` admin function:
  - Allows administrators to manually block/unblock automatic completion
  - Creates audit trail for completion override actions
  - Admin-only security with proper authorization checks
- Updated database triggers:
  - Replaced `trigger_auto_report_status` with enhanced version
  - Maintained backward compatibility with existing work order workflows
- **Business Impact**: Enables automatic work order completion while preserving admin control
- **Result**: Complete automated completion detection with manual override capabilities and email notifications

✅ **Comprehensive audit logging** on all core tables  
✅ **Optimized performance** with strategic indexes  
✅ **Analytics capabilities** with materialized views  
✅ **Role-based access control** working correctly  
✅ **Email notification system** fully implemented  
✅ **File attachment support** via Supabase Storage

## Lessons Learned

### RLS Implementation
- **Bootstrap Pattern**: Use `auth.uid()` directly for basic user access policies
- **Avoid recursion**: Never query the same table in RLS policies without bootstrap
- **Layered approach**: Bootstrap policies first, then role-based policies
- **Use helper functions**: SECURITY DEFINER functions prevent recursion in complex logic
- **Keep policies simple**: Complex logic belongs in functions, not policies

### Migration Strategy  
- **Incremental changes**: Small, focused migrations are easier to debug
- **Test thoroughly**: RLS issues can block all database access
- **Document purposes**: Many migrations lack clear documentation

### Performance Considerations
- **Index strategically**: RLS policies need supporting indexes
- **Use materialized views**: For complex analytics queries
- **Monitor query plans**: Ensure RLS doesn't create performance bottlenecks

## Future Migration Guidelines

1. **Always document migration purpose** in comments
2. **Test RLS changes** thoroughly before deployment  
3. **Consider performance impact** of new policies/triggers
4. **Maintain audit coverage** when adding new tables
5. **Use helper functions** for any complex RLS logic

### Supabase Edge Functions Infrastructure for Database Seeding

**Implementation**: Server-side database seeding infrastructure using Supabase Edge Functions

**Purpose**: Replace browser-based seeding with secure, server-side operations that bypass RLS policies

**Technical Implementation**:
- **Created Edge Function Structure**:
  - `supabase/functions/_shared/types.ts` - Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces
  - `supabase/functions/_shared/cors.ts` - Standardized CORS utilities
  - `supabase/functions/_shared/seed-data.ts` - Centralized test data definitions
  - `supabase/functions/seed-database/index.ts` - Main seeding function

**Why Edge Functions for Seeding**:
1. **RLS Bypass**: Browser-based seeding fails due to Row-Level Security policies that restrict data access. Edge functions use service role privileges to bypass these restrictions.
2. **Atomic Operations**: Server-side execution ensures complete success or rollback on failure, maintaining data integrity.
3. **Security**: Sensitive operations (user creation, admin data) handled server-side with proper access controls.
4. **Performance**: No browser limitations or network latency for large dataset operations.

**Security Model**:
- Function uses Supabase service role key for database operations
- Admin authentication through request validation
- Comprehensive audit logging for all operations
- Public function (no JWT verification) but admin-gated

**Features**:
- Complete database reset and seeding capabilities
- Selective data seeding for specific tables/categories
- Progress tracking and detailed status reporting
- Enhanced error handling and recovery procedures
- Comprehensive TypeScript type safety

**Documentation**:
- Created `supabase/functions/README.md` with development guidelines
- Local development setup and testing procedures
- Deployment and security considerations
- Troubleshooting guide and best practices

**Next Steps**:
- Update `useDevTools` hook to call Edge Function instead of browser-based seeding
- Maintain UI compatibility during transition
- Enhanced progress reporting and status updates
