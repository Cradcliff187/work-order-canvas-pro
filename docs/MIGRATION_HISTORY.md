**Purpose**: Unknown/undocumented migration

#### 20250710213726-8bf33131-39f2-426b-a1ba-dc0e985f04af.sql
**Purpose**: Unknown/undocumented migration

**Purpose**: Unknown/undocumented migration

#### 20250710230712-6f4c4413-17f5-4e75-845b-4b51d7a6ecd1.sql
**Purpose**: Unknown/undocumented migration

#### 20250710231449-07dca93d-8d85-4ca6-bb6b-a6685c8c2c5f.sql
**Purpose**: Unknown/undocumented migration

#### 20250710231829-66e11eca-c557-4820-87da-9b8c6138e381.sql
**Purpose**: **INCOMPLETE** - Attempted RLS recursion fix (did not resolve issue)
- Attempted to fix infinite recursion in profiles table RLS policies
- Still used helper functions that query profiles table
- **Issue**: Continued to cause "infinite recursion detected in policy" errors
- **Result**: System remained inaccessible, required additional fix

#### 20250710233253-1f8e068a-1441-4432-84e8-6b59796b9e43.sql
**Purpose**: Unknown/undocumented migration

### 2025-01-11: Critical RLS Fix and System Optimizations

#### 20250711035529-3ab24d6e-e01e-4941-97d0-b8c908d4523b.sql
**Purpose**: **INCOMPLETE** - Attempted RLS recursion fix (partial success)
- **Issue**: Previous RLS migrations (including 20250710231829) still caused "infinite recursion detected in policy for relation 'profiles'"
- **Root Cause**: ALL policies were calling helper functions that query profiles table (`auth_user_type()`, `auth_profile_id()`)
- **Attempted Solution**: Layered bootstrap approach with mixed success
- **Problem**: Still had some policies using recursive helper functions
- **Result**: Reduced but did not eliminate RLS recursion errors

#### 20250711042337-final-recursion-fix.sql
**Purpose**: **DEFINITIVE FIX** - Complete elimination of profiles table RLS recursion
- **Critical Issue**: ALL previous attempts had subqueries to profiles table within profiles policies
- **Root Cause**: ANY query to profiles table from within a profiles policy causes infinite recursion
- **Failed Approaches**: 
  - Helper functions that query profiles (recursion)
  - EXISTS subqueries to profiles (recursion)  
  - Direct subqueries to check user types (recursion)
  - Admin policies with `SELECT FROM profiles` (recursion)
- **Final Solution**: 
  - Stripped down to 3 minimal policies using ONLY `auth.uid()`
  - NO subqueries to profiles table whatsoever
  - Advanced permissions moved to application layer
  - Removed "Temp admin access" policy that contained recursive subquery
- **Result**: Complete elimination of error "infinite recursion detected in policy for relation 'profiles'"
- **Status**: **RECURSION RESOLVED** - Users can now log in successfully

**Key Learning**: Policies on the profiles table can NEVER query the profiles table - not even for admin access.

## Lessons Learned

### RLS Implementation
- **Bootstrap Pattern**: Use `auth.uid()` directly for basic user access policies
- **Avoid recursion**: Never query the same table in RLS policies without bootstrap
- **Layered approach**: Bootstrap policies first, then role-based policies
- **Use helper functions**: SECURITY DEFINER functions prevent recursion in complex logic
- **Keep policies simple**: Complex logic belongs in functions, not policies

### Migration Strategy  
- **Incremental changes**: Small, focused migrations are easier to debug
- **Test thoroughly**: RLS issues can block all database access
- **Document purposes**: Many migrations lack clear documentation

### Performance Considerations
- **Index strategically**: RLS policies need supporting indexes
- **Use materialized views**: For complex analytics queries
- **Monitor query plans**: Ensure RLS doesn't create performance bottlenecks

## Future Migration Guidelines

1. **Always document migration purpose** in comments
2. **Test RLS changes** thoroughly before deployment  
3. **Consider performance impact** of new policies/triggers
4. **Maintain audit coverage** when adding new tables
5. **Use helper functions** for any complex RLS logic

## Recent Migrations

### Migration 20250711140142 - Partner Reference Fields and Structured Addresses
**Date**: 2025-07-11  
**Purpose**: Enhanced partner integration and structured address management

**Changes**:
- **Partner Reference Fields**: Added `partner_po_number` and `partner_location_number` to work_orders table
- **Structured Address Fields**: Added `location_name`, `location_street_address`, `location_city`, `location_state`, `location_zip_code` for improved address handling
- **Performance Indexes**: Added indexes on new fields for efficient partner-based queries and geographic reporting
- **Backwards Compatibility**: Retained legacy address fields (`street_address`, `city`, `state`, `zip_code`) for seamless transition

**Business Impact**: 
- Partners can now reference their internal location numbers and PO systems
- Better address data quality with structured fields enabling mapping integrations
- Enhanced reporting capabilities for geographic distribution analysis
- Foundation for future mapping and location-based features

**Technical Impact**:
- Applications should migrate to structured address fields for new entries
- Address utility functions provide consistent formatting and validation
- Legacy fields remain functional for existing data

## Migration Best Practices

1. **Always document migration purpose** in comments
2. **Test RLS changes** thoroughly before deployment  
3. **Consider performance impact** of new policies/triggers
4. **Maintain audit coverage** when adding new tables
5. **Use helper functions** for any complex RLS logic
