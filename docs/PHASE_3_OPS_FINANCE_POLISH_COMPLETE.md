# Phase 3 – Ops/Finance Polish Completion Record

Overview
Phase 3 focused on stabilizing selection identity, standardizing column visibility persistence, and verifying export UX and dropdown layering across Reports and Invoices, plus a validation pass on Partner Invoices → Select Reports.

Changes summarized
- Tables now use getRowId: (row) => row.id for stable selection in Reports and Invoices
- Column visibility keys standardized to admin-<page>-columns-v1 with legacyKeys migration where needed (Invoices)
- Verified dropdown menus use z-50 bg-popover to avoid transparency/stacking issues
- Ensured Export buttons disable while loading and when no rows
- Confirmed EnhancedTableSkeleton usage for loading states

Affected areas
- Admin Reports table
- Admin Invoices table
- Shared: useColumnVisibility hook (legacyKeys migration)
- Partner Invoices → Select Reports page: validation of disabled states, totals, and confirmation dialog

Acceptance verification
- Selection remains stable across pagination and re-renders
- Column toggles persist on reload; legacy preferences migrate
- Export actions operate on correct IDs; disabled when loading/empty
- Dropdowns are opaque and layered above content

Roll-forward/rollback
- Non-breaking UI changes; if issues arise, revert to prior storageKey while retaining legacyKeys for auto-migration
