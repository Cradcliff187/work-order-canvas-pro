# Work Order Portal - Project Handoff

## Project Overview

The Work Order Portal is a comprehensive multi-tenant work order management system designed for construction and facilities management companies. It facilitates collaboration between internal teams, partner organizations, and subcontractors through a streamlined work order lifecycle from submission to completion.

**Key Features:**
- Organization-based multi-tenant architecture
- Real-time messaging and notifications
- Financial privacy between organizations
- Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities
- Queue-based email system with 100% reliability
- Smart work order numbering system

## Key Contacts

**Owner/Creator/Client:** Chris Radcliff  
**Email:** cradcliff@austinkunzconstruction.com  
**Organization:** Austin Kunz Construction  

**Platform:** Lovable.dev (AI-powered development)  
**Live Application:** https://workorderportal.lovable.app  

## Architecture Summary

### Frontend Stack
- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Vite** for build tooling
- **Tailwind CSS** + shadcn/ui components
- **React Router** for navigation
- **TanStack Query** for data fetching
- **PWA** capabilities with offline storage

### Backend Stack
- **Supabase** (PostgreSQL + Auth + Storage + Edge Functions)
- **Row Level Security (RLS)** for multi-tenant isolation
- **Real-time subscriptions** for live updates
- **pg_cron** for automated tasks

### Email System
- **Resend API** for email delivery
- **Queue-based processing** with retry logic
- **5-minute automated processing** via pg_cron
- **Delivery tracking** and status monitoring

### Development Platform
- **Lovable.dev** for AI-powered development
- **GitHub integration** available
- **Visual editing** capabilities

## Critical System Information

### Authentication Model
- **Organization-based authentication** (NOT user-type based)
- Users belong to organizations with specific roles
- Three organization types: Internal, Partner, Subcontractor
- Migration from legacy user-type system COMPLETE ✅

### Key System Parameters
- **Email processing**: Every 5 minutes via pg_cron
- **File storage**: Supabase Storage with organized buckets
- **Test environment**: 8 test users across all roles
- **Database**: 14 users, 8 organizations, 16+ work orders
- **PWA**: Offline-capable with IndexedDB storage

### Organization Types & Access
- **Internal (AKC Contracting)**: Admin, Manager, Employee roles
- **Partner Organizations**: Submit work orders, track status
- **Subcontractor Organizations**: Complete assigned work, submit reports

## Known Issues

### Current Warnings
- **58 RLS function search_path warnings** (informational only)
- These are non-critical PostgreSQL function warnings
- All security policies are properly enforced
- No functional impact on the application

### Mitigation
- Warnings do not affect security or functionality
- Can be addressed in future PostgreSQL function updates
- System operates at full capacity despite warnings

## Maintenance Tasks

### Daily
- Monitor email queue health (`monitor_email_queue()`)
- Check system health dashboard
- Review failed email notifications

### Weekly
- Run database health checks (`supabase/health_checks.sql`)
- Review user activity and organization membership
- Monitor storage usage and cleanup

### Monthly
- Security audit using Supabase linter
- Database performance optimization
- Update documentation as needed

### Quarterly
- Review and update RLS policies
- Performance benchmarking
- Feature prioritization and planning
