# WorkOrderPortal Company Access Guide

## Executive Summary

WorkOrderPortal provides **company-level access control** that enables teams to collaborate on work orders while maintaining financial privacy between organizations. This guide explains how the system works for business users and provides real-world usage scenarios.

## Business Model Overview

WorkOrderPortal facilitates a three-party construction management workflow:

**üè¢ Partners** submit work orders ‚Üí **üîß WorkOrderPortal** manages workflow ‚Üí **‚ö° Subcontractors** complete work

### Organization Types

| Type | Role | Access Level | Examples |
|------|------|--------------|----------|
| **üè¢ Partner** | Work order submitters | Own organization data + progress tracking | Property management companies, retail chains |
| **‚ö° Subcontractor** | Work performers | Assigned work orders + team reports | Plumbing companies, HVAC contractors, electricians |
| **üîß Internal** | Workflow managers | Full system access | General contractor, WorkOrderPortal administration |

## Company Access Features

### 1. Team-Based Work Orders

**Traditional Model**: Work orders assigned to individual users only
**Company Model**: Work orders assigned to entire organizations

```
‚ùå Old: Work order ‚Üí Individual subcontractor
‚úÖ New: Work order ‚Üí Subcontractor organization ‚Üí Any team member can work on it
```

**Business Benefits**:
- **Flexibility**: Any qualified team member can take on work
- **Scalability**: Add unlimited team members without individual setup
- **Continuity**: Work continues even if specific employees are unavailable
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute work across available team members

### 2. Organization-Level Assignments

**Example Scenario**: ABC Plumbing (5 employees) receives work order assignment

**Before Company Access**:
- Work order assigned to "John Smith" only
- Other ABC Plumbing employees cannot see or work on it
- If John is unavailable, work stops

**With Company Access**:
- Work order assigned to "ABC Plumbing" organization
- All 5 ABC Plumbing employees can see and work on it
- Any team member can submit reports
- Automatic backup coverage

### 3. Financial Privacy Model

**Company-Level Sharing with Cross-Company Privacy**:

| Data Type | Partner Visibility | Subcontractor Visibility | Admin Visibility |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------------|------------------|
| Work Order Details | ‚úÖ Own submissions | ‚úÖ Assigned work | ‚úÖ All work orders |
| Work Reports | ‚úÖ For own work orders | ‚úÖ Own organization reports | ‚úÖ All reports |
| Invoice Amounts | ‚ùå Cannot see | ‚úÖ Own organization invoices | ‚úÖ All invoices |
| Employee Rates | ‚ùå Cannot see | ‚ùå Cannot see | ‚úÖ All rates |

## Migration from Individual to Company Access

### Backward Compatibility

- **New Work Orders**: Can use organization-level assignments
- **Gradual Migration**: Move to company access at your own pace
- **No Data Loss**: All existing work orders and relationships preserved

### Migration Strategies

**Strategy 1: Immediate Organization Switch**
- Convert all future assignments to organization-level
- Benefits: Immediate team access improvements
- Considerations: Requires user training and process updates

**Strategy 2: Gradual Transition**
- Start with new subcontractor partners
- Migrate existing partners during contract renewals
- Benefits: Smooth transition with learning opportunities
- Considerations: Longer timeline to full benefits

**Strategy 3: Pilot Program**
- Test with select high-volume partners/subcontractors
- Refine processes based on pilot feedback
- Roll out system-wide after validation
- Benefits: Risk mitigation and process optimization

## Troubleshooting Company Access

### Common Questions

**Q: Can individual assignments still be used?**
A: Yes, the system supports both individual and organization-level assignments. Legacy work orders continue to function normally.

**Q: What happens if only one person in an organization needs access?**
A: Single-person organizations work perfectly. The company access model scales from 1 to unlimited users.

**Q: How do we prevent unauthorized team members from seeing sensitive work?**
A: Use organization assignments for general work, individual assignments for sensitive projects requiring specific clearance levels.

**Q: Can we restrict which team members can submit reports?**
A: Currently, any organization member can submit reports. Consider implementing internal approval processes before final submission.

### Access Issues

**Problem**: Team member cannot see organization work orders
**Solution**: Verify user is properly assigned to organization in user_organizations table

**Problem**: User sees work from wrong organization  
**Solution**: Check user organization assignments - users should only belong to their own organization

**Problem**: Financial data visible to wrong users
**Solution**: Review RLS policies - financial data should only be visible to same organization + admins

## Next Steps

1. **Review Current Setup**: Audit existing user-organization relationships
2. **Plan Migration**: Choose appropriate migration strategy for your organization
3. **Train Users**: Educate teams on company access benefits and workflows  
4. **Monitor Performance**: Track adoption and identify additional training needs
5. **Optimize Processes**: Refine workflows based on real-world usage patterns
