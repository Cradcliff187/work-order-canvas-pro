# WorkOrderPro

A comprehensive construction work order management system built with React, TypeScript, and Supabase.

## Project Overview

WorkOrderPro is a full-stack web application designed for managing construction work orders across multiple organizations with **company-level access control**. It enables partners to submit work orders, which are then routed to subcontractor organizations for completion, providing complete transparency while maintaining financial privacy between companies.

## WorkOrderPro Business Model

WorkOrderPro facilitates a three-party construction management workflow:

**üè¢ Partners (Property Management)** ‚Üí **üîß WorkOrderPro (General Contractor)** ‚Üí **‚ö° Subcontractors (Trade Companies)**

### Organization Types

- **üè¢ Partner Organizations**: Property management companies that submit work orders for their locations
- **‚ö° Subcontractor Organizations**: Trade companies (plumbing, HVAC, electrical) that perform the work  
- **üîß Internal Organization**: The general contractor company (WorkOrderPro Internal) that manages the workflow

### Company-Level Access Features

- **Team-Based Work Orders**: Multiple team members can collaborate on the same work orders
- **Organization-Level Assignments**: Work orders can be assigned to entire organizations, not just individuals
- **Company Financial Privacy**: Each organization can only see their own financial data (invoices, costs)
- **Cross-Company Transparency**: Work order details and reports are shared between relevant parties
- **Scalable User Management**: Add unlimited users to organizations without individual access setup

## Database Architecture

WorkOrderPro uses a PostgreSQL database with 12 core tables, implementing:

- **Complete audit logging** tracking all changes across 11 tables
- **Row Level Security (RLS)** with role-based access control
- **Multi-tenant architecture** supporting multiple organizations
- **Email notification system** with templates and delivery tracking
- **File attachment support** via Supabase Storage
- **Analytics capabilities** with materialized views for reporting
- **Edge Functions** for secure server-side operations and database management

## Edge Functions

The application uses Supabase Edge Functions for secure server-side operations:

### Available Functions
- **Database Management**: `seed-database`, `clear-test-data`
- **Email Notifications**: `email-work-order-created`, `email-work-order-assigned`, `email-work-order-completed`, `email-report-submitted`, `email-report-reviewed`, `email-welcome`
- **Invoice Processing**: `invoice-submitted`, `invoice-status-changed`
- **Webhooks**: `resend-webhook`

### Quick Deployment
```bash
# Deploy all functions
supabase functions deploy

# Deploy specific function
supabase functions deploy seed-database

# View logs
supabase functions logs seed-database --tail

# Set environment variables
supabase secrets set RESEND_API_KEY=your_key_here
```
