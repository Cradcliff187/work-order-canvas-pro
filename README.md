# WorkOrderPro

A comprehensive construction work order management system built with React, TypeScript, and Supabase.

## Project Overview

WorkOrderPro is a full-stack web application designed for managing construction work orders across multiple organizations with **company-level access control**. It enables partners to submit work orders, which are then routed to subcontractor organizations for completion, providing complete transparency while maintaining financial privacy between companies.

## WorkOrderPro Business Model

WorkOrderPro facilitates a three-party construction management workflow:

**üè¢ Partners (Property Management)** ‚Üí **üîß WorkOrderPro (General Contractor)** ‚Üí **‚ö° Subcontractors (Trade Companies)**

### Organization Types

- **üè¢ Partner Organizations**: Property management companies that submit work orders for their locations
- **‚ö° Subcontractor Organizations**: Trade companies (plumbing, HVAC, electrical) that perform the work  
- **üîß Internal Organization**: The general contractor company (WorkOrderPro Internal) that manages the workflow

### Company-Level Access Features

- **Team-Based Work Orders**: Multiple team members can collaborate on the same work orders
- **Organization-Level Assignments**: Work orders can be assigned to entire organizations, not just individuals
- **Company Financial Privacy**: Each organization can only see their own financial data (invoices, costs)
- **Cross-Company Transparency**: Work order details and reports are shared between relevant parties
- **Scalable User Management**: Add unlimited users to organizations without individual access setup
