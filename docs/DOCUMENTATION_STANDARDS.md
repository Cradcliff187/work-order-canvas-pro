# Documentation Standards

## File Naming Conventions

### Avoid Similar Names
- Don't create files with similar purposes and names (e.g., GUIDE.md vs COMPLETE_GUIDE.md)
- Use descriptive suffixes: QUICKSTART.md, COMPLETE.md, REFERENCE.md

### Clear Purpose in Names
- SETUP_*.md for installation/configuration
- GUIDE_*.md for how-to guides
- REFERENCE_*.md for API/function references
- TROUBLESHOOTING_*.md for problem-solving

## Content Organization

### One Source of Truth
- Each topic should have ONE primary document
- Link to related docs rather than duplicating content
- Use clear section headers for navigation

### Highlight Major Features
- Important features (like automated processing) should be prominently displayed
- Use callout boxes for critical information
- Put key benefits in overview sections

## Maintenance

### Regular Reviews
- Check for outdated references quarterly
- Update after major migrations
- Verify all links work

### Change Tracking
- Note last updated date at document end
- Link to migration docs for major changes
- Keep historical docs in an archive/ folder
